Quick Notes
-For pushbuttons
--Inputs are AN1-AN5
--Make sure to put the input to the MICRO through a 1k Ohm resistor (Brown,Black,Read)

-For LED's
--Can use small Red LED's with no resistor
--Can use color coded LED's with 330 Ohm resistor (Orange,Orange, Brown)
--Long end goes to MICRO, short end goes to ground

(Both sets of Resistors should be on small breadboard
